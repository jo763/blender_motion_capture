# Blender Motion Capture
- This project intends to use Google's Mediapipe package, which uses machine learning to be able to motion track a person via a camera stream or video, to animate an already created and rigged model ("Blenda") produced by Royal Skies
- This project then intends to be able to produce animations that can then be exported for other projects
- Currently left arm tracking works albeit a bit poorly. So the camera can track when the user lifts and moves their left arm, and the model arm will move in a similar fashion as a result
